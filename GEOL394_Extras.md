# GEOL394 Extras

Hello! Thank you for visiting. This page just contains some extras from my GEOL394 poster on the "Influence of Road Salt on the Mobilization of Bioreactive Elements in Regenerative Stormwater Conveyance Systems".

Fig. 1 is an illustration I made of an RSC, loosely adapted from Williams et. al (2016)

In the upper left, I've overlayed a map of the Anacostia River Watershed with a star indicating the approximate location of the study watershed. This image is in the public domain provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (March 25, 2015).

My methodology schematic is based on methods derived from Duan and Kaushal (2015) and Haq et al. (2018).
